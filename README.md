### 1. Introduction

The VN30 index serves as a key indicator of market performance in Vietnam. This project addresses the challenges of analyzing high-frequency stock data and explores potential methods for forecasting price movements. 

### 2. Data Preparation

- **Data Import**: We load and prepare a dataset of stock transaction records, reversed to sort from the oldest to the most recent date.
- **Data Summary**: The dataset includes buy prices, sell prices, and transaction volumes for 30 companies in the VN30 group.
- **Preprocessing**: We ensure the dataset contains no null values or duplicates.

### 3. Data Analysis

The data is divided by stock attributes such as buy price, sell price, and volumes, allowing for focused analysis. Key insights include:
- The distribution of transaction volumes throughout the trading day.
- Cash flow analysis through the calculation of total buy and sell values.

### 4. Feature Engineering

We conduct feature engineering to:
- Identify the most active trading times.
- Calculate average prices and transaction volumes to improve prediction models.

### 5. Modeling

The notebook employs various machine learning and deep learning models, such as:
- **Linear Regression** for basic prediction.
- **LSTM Networks** for time series prediction, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras.

### 6. Results

Model performance is evaluated based on Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and RÂ² Score. We analyze the predictive power of different models and compare them to assess the most effective approach for forecasting VN30 stock movements.

### 7. Future Work

Potential improvements include:
- Expanding the dataset to include additional market factors.
- Testing additional machine learning models for better predictive accuracy.
